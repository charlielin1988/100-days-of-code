# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, July 18th, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed Javascript essentials from Codecademy's course on Javascript

**Thoughts:**

A little rusty on my JS basic commands, but it's coming back through this course!

### Day 2: Tuesday, July 19th, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed conditionals, if else statements, comparison, and ternary operators

**Thoughts:**

Muscle memory coming back!

### Day 3: Wednesday, July 20th, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Reviewed control flow, switch cases

**Thoughts:**
The syntax of switch cases is a lot.

### Day 4: Thursday, July 21st, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Reviewed functions, function expressions, parameters and arguments, helper functions, and syntax for concise arrow functions

**Thoughts:**
Although concise arrow functions and ternary expressions may help make code drier, I don't feel that combining the two makes code as legible when working on a team. Not the method I would likely use.

### Day 5: Friday, July 22nd, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Finished function review and started on scope review
**Thoughts:**
The syntax of arrow functions is getting easier to remember with repeated practice, although I still feel a little murky on when exactly the return keyword is needed.

### Day 5: Monday, July 25th, 2022

**Today's Progress:**
Reviewed Arrays: syntax, accessing elements, methods, functions, and nested arrays
**Thoughts:**
I remember syntax for array methods!
